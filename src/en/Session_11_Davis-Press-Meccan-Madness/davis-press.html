                                <li><strong>Religious Provocation:</strong> The plot represents a direct provocation for the Islamic world. The fictional occupation of the Kaaba by a woman and a revolutionary movement contradicts fundamental religious and cultural principles of Islam and could be interpreted as blasphemous.</li>
                                <li><strong>Parallels to Salman Rushdie:</strong> The striking parallels to the case of Salman Rushdie and his work "The Satanic Verses" are unmistakable. Rushdie's novel triggered a global scandal that led to death threats, assassination attempts, and a fatwa. Davis Press risks igniting a similar storm of indignation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Geopolitical Context:</strong> The tense geopolitical situation after 9/11, the Iraq War, and the Guantanamo incidents has intensified anti-Western resentment in many Muslim countries. In this climate, publication could provoke particularly explosive reactions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> The personal safety of all involved - especially the publisher's staff and the author - is at stake. Carol Davis bears the moral responsibility for protecting her employees.</li>

                                <li><strong>Freedom of Expression vs. Respect:</strong> How far does editorial freedom extend when religious feelings could be hurt? Is the deliberate provocation of religious values through literature justified?</li>

                                <li><strong>Literary Value vs. Social Impact:</strong> Does the literary quality justify the possible negative social consequences and security risks?</li>
                                <li><strong>Publisher's Responsibility:</strong> What responsibility does a publisher bear for the content it publishes and for the safety of its employees?</li>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The "Davis Press - Meccan Madness" case illustrates the complex trade-offs between artistic freedom, economic interests, and social responsibility in a highly sensitive religious and geopolitical context. It shows that business decisions often have to be made in a field of tension between different values and interests.</p>
                    
                    <p>As one commentator aptly noted: <em>"Can a bestseller be justified if the price is a potential fatwa against the publisher and author?"</em> This question highlights the core dilemma of the case. Carol Davis must decide whether she wants to go down in history as a brave defender of freedom of expression or whether the publication is a risky marketing maneuver with potentially dangerous consequences.</p>
                    
                    <p>The analysis of this case provides valuable insights into ethical decision-making processes and the importance of careful consideration of all relevant factors. Regardless of the decision ultimately made, a transparent and reflective decision-making process is crucial for a company's integrity - especially when the consequences can be so far-reaching.</p>
